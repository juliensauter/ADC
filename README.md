### 🚀 **Superiority Demonstration**

#### Fast Convergence

Compared with [Siamese-Diffusion](https://github.com/Qiukunpeng/Siamese-Diffusion), the proposed approach slightly increases training memory usage due to the joint training of a teacher model, which provides stronger prior guidance for the student model, ultimately accelerating its convergence.  

Even without using the plug-and-play `Online-Augmentation` module from [Siamese-Diffusion](https://github.com/Qiukunpeng/Siamese-Diffusion), our method achieves competitive performance on [Polyp-PVT](https://github.com/DengPingFan/Polyp-PVT).

### 🛠️ Requirements
The usual installation steps involve the following commands, they should set up the correct CUDA version and all the python packages:
```bash
conda create -n ADC python=3.10
conda activate  ADC
conda install pytorch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0  pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install -U xformers --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install deepspeed
```

### 🗂️ Data and Structure
We evaluated our method on three public datasets: [Polyps](https://github.com/DengPingFan/PraNet) (as provided by the PraNet project), and [Kidney Tumor](https://github.com/neheller/kits19/).
```bash
--data
  --images
  --masks
  --prompt.json
```

### 🏋️‍♂️ Training

💡 **Note:** The core contribution code has been integrated into `cldm.py`. Corresponding improvements to the model architecture should be made in `ldm/modules/diffusionmodules/openaimodel.py`, and the configuration must be updated in `models/cldm_v15.yaml`.  

A new initialization scheme has been implemented in `tool_add_control.py` to accommodate changes in the model architecture and generate `control_sd15.ckpt`.

Inspired by [Siamese-Diffusion](https://github.com/Qiukunpeng/Siamese-Diffusion), the **DHI** module is integrated as a default component.

Here are example commands for training:
```bash
# Initialize ControlNet with the pretrained UNet encoder weights from Stable Diffusion,  
# then merge them with Stable Diffusion weights and save as: control_sd15.ckpt  
python tool_add_control.py

# For multi-GPU setups, ZeRO-2 can be used to train Siamese-Diffusion  
# to reduce memory consumption.  
python tutorial_train.py
```

### 🎨 Sampling
Here are example commands for sampling:
```bash
# ZeRO-2 distributed weights are saved under the folder:  
# lightning_logs/version_#/checkpoints/epoch/  
# Run the following commands to merge the weights:  
python zero_to_fp32.py . pytorch_model.bin  
python tool_merge_control.py

# Sampling
python tutorial_inference.py
```
